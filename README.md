# Hangman

## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game is played between two players: one who sets the word and one who tries to guess it. This version of Hangman can be played solo against the computer.

## How to Play
1. Start the Game: The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. Guess the Word: You have to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.
3. Feedback: For each correct letter guessed, the computer reveals its position(s) in the word.
4. Incorrect Guesses: You have a total of 5 attempts to guess the word. Each incorrect guess counts as one attempt.
5. Winning the Game: You win if you can guess the word within 5 attempts.
6. Losing the Game: You lose if you fail to guess the word within 5 attempts.
